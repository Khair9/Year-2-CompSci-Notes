## Exam Info
 - Exam structure: solve 1 out of 2 provided problems, each problem is weighted at 100%.
 - Each problem has two parts, and each part is valued at 50%.
### How to approach the exam
 - Revise using our workshops and tutorial problem sets.
 - For graphing: label everything clearly, know what goes on each axis, know what each function is.
 - Explain everything that you are doing in detail ‚Äì why did the curve shift in this particular way? Why is the solution to the problem using this particular formula? Etc. 
 - And overall, do not overthink your solutions. Economics is quite a logical and common-sense discipline.

 - Be prepared: go through your lecture notes, workshops, and tutorials ‚Äì they will all be helpful. Pay special attention to the AD-AS topics, and do not neglect going over weeks 6 and 7, especially their workshop related materials.
- You have enough time to think carefully and tackle the questions, so be calm.
-  Carefully read all the questions before choosing. Do not
solve them for wrong models!
- Do not try to solve more than 1 question, otherwise, the marking team will choose which of the two questions to check at random.

------------------------
### Utilitarianism
Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. 

### Maximin
**Definition**: Choose the option where the worst possible outcome is better than the worst outcomes of the alternatives.

### Nozick‚Äôs Views on Justice
Entitlement Theory: Nozick believed justice is about historical entitlements, not outcomes.
- **Justice in Acquisition**: You‚Äôre entitled to something if you acquired it justly.
- **Justice in Transfer:** You‚Äôre entitled to what you get through free exchange.
- **Rectification of Injustice:** If something was taken unjustly, it must be corrected.
- **Key Idea:** As long as holdings were acquired and transferred fairly, inequality is not unjust.
- **Critique of Rawls:** Nozick argued that redistributive taxation (e.g., to help the poor) is a violation of individual rights‚Äî‚Äútaxation is forced labor.‚Äù

### Fisher‚Äôs Equation 
The Fisher Equation relates nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and inflation:

$ùëñ=ùëü+ùúã$

$i=r+œÄ$

**Where**:

```i = Nominal interest rate```

```r = Real interest rate```

```œÄ = Expected inflation rate```

**Key idea:** The nominal interest rate compensates lenders for both the time value of money (real interest) and the expected loss of purchasing power due to inflation.
This equation is fundamental in understanding how inflation expectations influence interest rates and monetary policy.
