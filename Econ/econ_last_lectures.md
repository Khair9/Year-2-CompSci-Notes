# [Lecture 17 (Chapter 31) Inflation and the Quantity Theory of Money](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/Econ/econ.md)
 - **Inflation**: An increase in the average level of prices
 - Inflation is measured by changes in a price index.
 - The inflation rate is the percentage change in a price index from one year to the next.

### price indexees
1. **Consumer price index (CPI):** Measures the average price for a basket of goods and services bought by a typical consumer; covers thousands of goods and services and is weighted so major items count more.
1. **GDP deflator:** The ratio of nominal to real GDP multiplied by 100; covers finished goods and services. 
1. **Producer price indexes (PPI):** Measure the average price received by producers; includes intermediate and finished goods and services.

### Quantity Theory of Money

 - M = Money Supply
 - P = Price level
 - v = Velocity of money
 - YR = Real GDP
 - Since Mv is the total amount spent on finished goods and services, and PYR is the the price level times real GDP, both sides of this equation are also equal to nominal GDP.
 - **Velocity of money** The average number of times a dollar is spent on finished goods and services in a year. In short, it refers to how fast money passes from one holder to the next.

 - **Deflation**: A decrease in the average level of prices (a negative inflation rate).
 - **Disinflation**: A reduction in the inflation rate.
 - **Money illusion**: When people mistake changes in nominal prices for changes in real prices.
 - **Real rate of return**: The nominal rate of return minus the inflation rate.
 - **Nominal rate of return**: The rate of return that does not account for inflation.

 - **Fisher effect:** The tendency of nominal interest rates to rise with expected inflation rates.
 - The Fisher effect says that **the nominal interest rate is equal to the expected inflation rate plus the equilibrium real interest rate.**

So, basically saying if the actual intrest rates are higher than expected then it benifits borrower, if it is the other way round it benefit lenders

# Lecture 18 (Chapter 32) Business Fluctuations: Aggregate Demand and Supply

- Aggregate Demand (AD) Curve:
   - $\vec{M}$ + $\vec{v}$ = AD curve
   - $\vec{M}$ + $\vec{v}$ = _Inflation + Real growth_
   - Shows the total quantity of goods and services demanded across the economy at different price levels.
   - Slopes downward because:
       - As prices fall, real wealth increases (wealth effect).
       - Lower price levels reduce interest rates, stimulating investment (interest rate effect).
       - Lower domestic prices make exports more competitive (exchange rate effect).
    - Aggregate Demand (AD) **why its called that:**
         - "Aggregate" means total or overall.
         - "Demand" refers to the quantity of goods and services that consumers, businesses, the government, and foreigners are willing to buy.
         - So, the AD curve shows the total demand for an economy’s output at various price levels.
         - It’s called a "curve" because it slopes downward—meaning that as the general price level falls, the total quantity demanded increases.

 - Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) Curve:
    - Represents the total output an economy can produce when using all resources efficiently (i.e., at full employment).
    - Vertical in the long run because output is determined by factors like technology, labor, and capital—not the price level.
    - Reflects potential GDP (natural level of output).
    - **why it is called what its called**
     
         - "Long-Run" refers to a time period in which all inputs (labor, capital, etc.) are variable and the economy is at full employment.
         - "Aggregate Supply" means the total output that firms are willing and able to produce.
         - In the long run, output is not affected by price levels—it's determined by resources and technology. That’s why the LRAS is a vertical line: no matter what the price level is, the economy will always produce at its potential output.
         - It's "long-run" to distinguish it from the "short-run" scenario, where prices and wages can be sticky.
     
    
The intersection of the AD and LRAS curves shows the long-run equilibrium of the economy.

### SRAS - Short-Run Aggregate Supply curve
- 📈 What is the SRAS Curve
    - The SRAS curve shows the total quantity of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing and able to produce at different price levels in the short run.
    - It is upward sloping, meaning that as the overall price level increases, the quantity of goods and services supplied also increases.
- 💡 Why is it Upward Sloping?
    - In the short run:
    - Wages and some input prices are “sticky” (they don’t adjust immediately to changes in the economy).
    - When the overall price level rises, but input costs (like wages) remain the same:
    - Firms see higher profit margins, so they are incentivized to produce more.
    - Conversely, if prices fall but costs don’t, profits shrink, and firms reduce output.
- 🎯 Key Features:
    - Short-run means some prices (especially wages) are fixed due to contracts or slow adjustments.
    - The slope of the SRAS reflects how responsive supply is to changes in the price level in the short term
    - It's not vertical because firms respond to profit opportunities before all prices and wages adjust.
- ⚠️ What Causes the SRAS to Shift?
    - Increases in production costs (like oil or wages) shift SRAS left (↓ supply).
    - Improvements in productivity or lower input prices shift it right (↑ supply).
    - Expectations of future inflation can also shift SRAS, as firms adjust their behavior now.

# A bit about monetary and fiscal policy in relation to AD-AS

- **Monetary Polcicy** --> Monetary policy is the action a central bank or a government can take to influence how much money is in a country's economy and how much it costs to borrow.
- **Central bank tools**
   -  Increase the rate of growth of the money supply
   - Reduce interest rates and encourage more borrowing

- **Fiscal policy:** Federal government policy on taxes, spending, and borrowing that is designed to influence business fluctuations.
