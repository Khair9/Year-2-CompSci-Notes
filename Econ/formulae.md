 - M = Money Supply
 - P = Price level
 - v = Velocity of money
 - YR = Real GDP
 - Since Mv is the total amount spent on finished goods and services, and PYR is the the price level times real GDP, both sides of this equation are also equal to nominal GDP.
 - **Velocity of money** The average number of times a dollar is spent on finished goods and services in a year. In short, it refers to how fast money passes from one holder to the next.
