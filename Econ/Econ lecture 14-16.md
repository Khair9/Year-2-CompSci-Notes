# [Lecture 14 (Chapter 26) GDP and the Measurement of Progress](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/Econ/econ.md)

 - **Gross domestic product (GDP):** The market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a year.

### what counts towards GDP
 - Intermediate goods are sold to firms and then bundled or processed with other goods or services for sale at a later stage.
 - Finished goods are sold to final users and then consumed or held in personal inventories.
 - To avoid double counting, only finished goods are included in GDP.
 - However, machinery and equipment used to produce other goods are included in GDP.

 - **Gross national product (GNP)** The market value of all finished goods and services produced by a country’s permanent residents, wherever they are located, within a year.

### ways of calculating gdp
Three common ways:
 - **National spending approach:** Add up the components of spending.Y = C + I + G + (Exports – Imports)
 - **Factor income approach:** Add up the income generated by producing goods and services.Y = Employee Compensation + Rent + Interest + Profit
 - **Value added per firm approach:** value of sales – costs of intermediate goods. This number is then summed up for all the firms within the economy.

 - **Nominal variables:** Variables, such as nominal GDP, that have not been adjusted for changes in price.

 - **Real variables:** Variables such as real GDP that have been adjusted for changes in prices by using the same set of prices in all time periods.

``` GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP)/(Real GDP) * 100 ```

 - **Recession:** A significant, widespread decline in real GDP and employment.
 - **Business fluctuations** (or business cycles): Short-run movements in real GDP around its long-term trend.

GDP does not include:
 - Goods in the underground economy
 - The value of goods that are difficult to price
 - The value of bads
 - The health of nations
 - The distribution of income

# Lecture 15 (Chapter 27) The Wealth of Nations and Economic Growth
Economic growth is measured as:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe749126-5219-4240-a95a-6b3b43bc8dcb)

Where:
- ```gt = growth rate of real GDP per capita```
- ```yt = real GDP per capita in time period t```

##### Rule of 70
_The rule of 70 approximates the length of time necessary for a growing variable to double_

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31a93e66-30e2-4647-ad25-3141ca4fcace)

_Example: If real GDP per capita is growing at an annual growth rate of 3.5%, it will double in:_

``` 70/3.5 = 20 ```

##### value of GDP for any given year, 𝑦𝑡
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a97989c-a4c9-4055-9d03-b904cf6afcf0)
In the formula:
- 𝑦0 is the value of GDP in the beginning year
- 𝑦𝑡 is the value of GDP for the specific year in question
- 𝑔𝑦 is the growth rate
- t is the number of years after 𝑦0.


 - **Institutions:** The “rules of the game” that structure economic incentives.
 - Institutions of economic growth include:
    - Property rights
    - Honest government
    - Political stability
    - A dependable legal system
    - Competitive and open markets
 
# Lecture 16 (Chapter 30)Unemployment and Labor Force Participation
 - **Unemployed workers:** Adults who do not have a job, but who are looking for work.
 - **Unemployment rate:** The percentage of the labor force without a job.
##### Criteria for being unemployed
Someone is unemployed only if he or she is willing and able to work but cannot find a job.

To be counted as unemployed, a person must meet these criteria:
 - 16 years or older
 - Not institutionalized (e.g., not in prison)
 - A civilian
 - Looking for work

- **Labor force participation rate:** The percentage of adults in the labor force.

 - **Discouraged workers:** Workers who have given up looking for work but who would still like a job.
 - **Frictional unemployment:** Short-term unemployment caused by the ordinary difficulties of matching employee to employer
 - **Structural unemployment:** Persistent, long-term unemployment caused by long-lasting shocks or permanent features of an economy that make it more difficult for some workers to find jobs.
 - **Union:** An association of workers that bargains collectively with employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions.
 - **Employment at-will doctrine:** An employee may quit, and an employer may fire an employee at any time and for any reason. There are many exceptions to the at-will doctrine, but it is the most basic U.S. employment law.
 - **Active labor market policies:** Policies such as work tests, job search assistance, and job retraining programs that focus on getting unemployed workers back to work.
 - **Cyclical unemployment:** Unemployment correlated with the business cycle.
 - **Natural unemployment rate:** The rate of structural plus frictional unemployment.
