## XML
### Background of XML
 - **XML**	stands	for	**“eXtensible	Markup Language”**
Why	did	the	W3C	design	XML?
 - Mark-up	for	the	web	was	not	being	properly supported
 - Standard	Generalized	Mark-up	Language	(SGML)	was	too	complex	
 - While,	HTML	was	too	limited	and	mixed	format	with structure

##### [Sample XML script](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/WAD/sampleXML.xml)

The	structure	of	XML	is	tightly	controlled:

- Tags	are	case	sensitive	and	variable	values	must	be	quoted	
- If	there	is	a	start	tag,	there	must	be	an	end	tag
- A	hierarchical	structure	of	elements	is	enforced	
- These	are	not	strictly	enforced	in	the	case	in	HTML
