# Lecture 7-9
## üìö Common Tiered Architecture Models:
### 1. Two-Tier Architecture:
- **Client Tier (Frontend)**: The user's device/browser that sends requests and displays data.
- **Server Tier (Backend + Database)**: A server that processes requests and interacts with the database.
üß† Used in simple apps. Can get messy as app complexity grows.

### 2. Three-Tier Architecture (most common):
- **Presentation Tier**:
     - This is the frontend (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS).
     - Handles what the user sees and interacts with.
- **Application Tier (or Business Logic Layer)**:
     - The backend server (e.g., Node.js, Django, Java Spring).
     - Handles logic, processing, and decision-making.
- **Data Tier**:
     - The database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
     - Stores and retrieves data.
- üß† Helps separate responsibilities, making development and debugging easier.

### 3. N-Tier Architecture:

A more complex form of the 3-tier model.

#### May have extra layers like:
- API layer
- Authentication layer
- Microservices layer
- Caching laye
üß† Useful for large-scale applications or enterprise systems.

### üîç Why Use Tiered Architectures?
Benefit	Description
- Separation of concerns	Each tier handles a specific part of the app.
- Scalability	You can scale individual tiers independently.
- Maintainability	Easier to manage and update different parts of the system.
- Reusability	Logic or components in one tier can be reused in other projects.
- Security	Each tier can enforce its own access rules and validation.

### üí° Example:
Think of an online bookstore:
- Presentation Tier: A web page showing book listings.
- Application Tier: Code that checks inventory, processes orders, applies discounts.
- Data Tier: The database with book information, prices, and customer orders.
- Would you like a diagram or code example for better visualization?


### Middleware
- Within	the	middleware	tier,	usually	there	is	a	webserver,	an	application	server,	and	potential	media	servers	
- Webserver:	handles	incoming	requests,	directing	them	to	the	appropriate	server	
- Servers	could	be	on	the	same	machine	or	different	machines

### The benefits of tiered architecture benefits
 - Tiers	enable	the	separation	of	concerns	
 - Tiers	encapsulate	complexity		
 - they	can	be	broken	down	into	layers	or	into	sub-tiers	
 - Tiers	can	be	distributed	across	a	number	of machines	
 - Providing	flexibility	
 - Providing	more	security	(as	clients	do	not	interact directly	with	the	database)	
 - Tiers	can	be	replicated	across	a	number	of	machines	
 - Providing	scalability

| **Entity**                       | **Definition**                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User**                         | The human or automated actor who initiates interactions with the system, typically via a client application (e.g., browser, mobile app).               |
| **Client**                       | The frontend application or interface used by the user to send requests and receive responses (e.g., web browser, mobile app UI).                      |
| **Middleware**                   | The intermediary logic layer that processes client requests, applies business logic, and manages communication between client and backend.             |
| **Database/Datastore**           | A structured system for storing, retrieving, and managing data (e.g., SQL/NoSQL databases, file storage systems).                                      |
| **Logs/Files**                   | Persistent storage of system-generated events, errors, or user activity, used for auditing, debugging, and monitoring (e.g., log files, audit trails). |
| **External Service/Application** | Third-party or separate systems that the application communicates with (e.g., payment gateways, email services, APIs, cloud functions).                |
| **Communications/DataFlows**     | The actual data transmitted between entities‚Äîsuch as HTTP requests/responses, API calls, database queries, and service messages.                       |


### Information Architecture (IA)
1.The	structural	design	of	shared	information	environments	
2. The	combination	of	organisation,	labelling,	search and	navigation	systems	within	web	sites	and	intranets	
3. The	art	and	science	of	shaping	information	products	and	experiences	to	support	usability	and	findability	
4. An	emerging	discipline	and	community	of	practice,	focused	on	bringing	principles	of	design	and architecture	to	the	digital	landscape

#### Why information architecture is important
| **Factor**               | **Explanation**                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost of finding**      | Poor IA can lead to **users wasting time** and becoming **frustrated** trying to locate content.  |
| **Cost of not finding**  | If users can't find what they need, they may make **bad decisions** or turn to **other sources**. |
| **Cost of construction** | Building a solid IA requires **skilled people, time, and planning**‚Äîbut it's an investment.       |
| **Cost of maintenance**  | Bad IA makes **content harder to manage** and more expensive to redesign or update later.         |
| **Cost of training**     | A confusing system increases the time and money needed to **train staff**, especially new hires.  |
| **Value of brand**       | A clear, usable structure builds **trust** and strengthens the **brand identity and reputation**. |

#### IA Deliverables
IAs	have	a	number of	tools and	techniques that	they	employ.	
These include:	
 - Developing	User	Personas	
 - Identifying	and	prioritizing	their	needs	
 - Mocking up	Wireframes	
 - Showing	the	sequence	of	interaction	through	 Walk-throughs

### Creating the blueprint of the website
 - **Site Mapping:** this provides a high level snapshot of how all the webpages on a site link together
 - **URL design:** Translating	the	site	map	into	a	coherent	and	logical URL	design	is	an	important	part	of	site	design
 - **Usability Testing:** 
      - task	sheets
      - feedback	questionnaires	
      - Conducting	tests	
      - Reporting	results	
      - Saves	unnecessary effort	and	time	
      - Helps	to	convince the	clients
