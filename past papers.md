Based on the marks you lost in the test, here are the main topics I recommend you focus on for revision:

Algorithm Analysis (Big-O, Recurrences):

1. Recurrence Relations: You missed solving recurrences (Q1e, Q2c). Practice solving recurrence relations, especially using the Master Theorem, as it's crucial for analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms.
Detailed Analysis: Review how to perform line-by-line asymptotic analysis for iterative algorithms (Q1c) and how to determine worst-case and best-case running times (Q5b).
Algorithm Design Paradigms (Divide and Conquer):

1. The biggest loss of marks was in Q1d, where you didn't provide a divide-and-conquer solution as required. Focus on understanding the divide-and-conquer strategy: breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively (conquer), and combining the results. Study classic examples like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and the majority element algorithm from the mark scheme.
Data Structures (Stacks, Design Constraints):

1. In Q4b, your proposed solution didn't meet the constant time (O(1)) requirement for all operations (PUSH, POP, MIN). Review standard data structures like stacks and how they can be combined or augmented (like the two-stack solution in the mark scheme) to achieve specific performance guarantees.
Sorting Algorithms (Properties & Implementation):

1. You correctly identified instability in Selection Sort (Q3a) but only partially described how to make it stable (Q3b). Review properties like stability for various sorting algorithms and understand the implementation details required to modify or ensure these properties.
Hashing:

 1. Your approach to generating hash collisions in Q5d was flawed. Review how basic polynomial rolling hash functions work and understand common techniques for finding collisions, such as finding small equivalent blocks as shown in the mark scheme solution.
Concentrating on these areas, particularly Algorithm Analysis (Big-O, Recurrences) and Divide and Conquer, should help address the major gaps highlighted by the test. Good luck with your revision!
